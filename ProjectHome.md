[EOClipse](EOClipse.md) stands for "Earth Observation on Eclipse". It is a collection of plug-ins running on top of Equinox enabling the Earth Observation community to rapidly design, build and run Services making use of Satellite Imagery and GIS data.

As such, the framework offers the full range of utilities, including: import of data, data readers, some generic data processing elements, visualisation tools (GIS, image, metadata), export functions and process hosting.

The EOClipse plug-ins offer many extension points to easily provide add on functionality without worrying about its integration with the rest of the framework. Typical extension points include views, processes, import methods and readers.

In addition, a hosting service will be available to host and run in the cloud EO Services built with EOClipse.
